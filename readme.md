## Executive Summary
This repository provides infrastructure to execute trading strategies on the Deribit Exchange. The project can execute Trading strategies by implementing the Subject Observer Design Pattern, which is a behavioural pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. 

The project provides the ability to observe multiple trading instruments and asynchronously trade and observe multiple trading strategies. This is done by utilizing a WebSocket connection to the Deribit exchange, which provides the ability to receive high-frequency trading data. All observable relationships, e.g., implied volatility of all currency-specific instruments, require some calculation, although all calculations have optimized to ensure optimal execution speed with spread computational load. Aysncio queues are implemented in the Producer Consumer design pattern, this provides the infrastructure to enable cross task/thread communication whilst decoupling producers & consumers.

Observers are employed to observe real-time instrument pricing on the Deribit Exchange, allowing the execution of arbitrage, relative value and spread trading strategies based on pricing inefficiencies. Price feeds are generated by subscribing to multiple instrument orderbooks via the ServiceDeribitInstrumentsSubscriptionManager, which provides the optionality of dynamic subscription management to reflect any dynamic live strategy. This project then provides the ability to utilise the observer managers, which allows for dynamic management of observations aligned with the management of subscriptions.
